# DALEK_Pi
A repository created to store items related to my DALEK Pi project.
daleh.sh is a bash script that, when run, takes live audio from the microphone and adds varios effects to simulate a Dalek voice.
dalekout.wav is a recording to demonstrate the results.
sound_level.py is a Python program that reads the sound output and displays it as an integer.
sound_led.py is an extension of sound_level.py that takes the output and uses it to control an led to creat sound to light for the Dalek Dome lights.
